Brake rotors of disc brakes rotate with the wheels and brake pads which are fitted to the brake calipers clamp on these rotors to stop or decelerate the wheels The brake pads pushing against the rotors generate friction which transforms kinetic energy into a thermal energy. The crankshaft is a crucial component in an automotive vehicles engine playing a vital role in converting the linear motion of the pistons into rotational energy Primary Function Rotational Energy Conversion The crankshafts primary function is to convert the upanddown motion of the pistons into rotational energy which is then transmitted to the transmission and eventually the wheels How it Works Piston Motion The pistons move up and down in the cylinders driven by the explosive force of the combustion process Crankshaft Rotation The pistons motion is transferred to the crankshaft via the connecting rods causing the crankshaft to rotate Rotational Energy The rotating crankshaft converts the linear motion of the pistons into rotational energy Key Functions Energy Conversion The crankshaft converts the energy released by the combustion process into rotational energy Power Transmission The crankshaft transmits power from the engine to the transmission and eventually the wheels Engine Performance The crankshafts design and operation directly impact engine performance efficiency and power output Components Crankpins The crankpins connect the connecting rods to the crankshaft transferring force from the pistons Main Bearings The main bearings support the crankshaft allowing it to rotate smoothly Counterweights The counterweights balance the crankshafts rotation reducing vibration and stress Common Issues Crankshaft Wear Worn or damaged crankshaft components can cause engine performance issues Bearing Failure Failed main bearings can cause the crankshaft to seize leading to engine failure Counterweight Damage Damaged counterweights can cause vibration and engine imbalance Maintenance Tips Regular Oil Changes Maintain proper oil levels and change oil regularly to prevent crankshaft wear TuneUps Regular tuneups can help identify and address crankshaftrelated issues before they become major problems Engine Balancing Ensure the engine is properly balanced to reduce crankshaft stress and wear.

THE MAIN PARTS OF CAR ENGINE AND ITS FUNCTIONS Vehicles move as a result of the combination of two processes that take place in the internal combustion engine ICE the ignition and combustion of the fuel occurs within the engine itself The engine then partially converts the energy from the combustion into heat and mechanical torque In order for this to happen the engine is made up of several individual components working simultaneously all essential MAIN CAR ENGINE PARTS This post address four of the most relevant main parts of a car engine starting from the cylinders to the camshaft Engine block The engine block is the block bone of the cars engine such as the pistons the crankshaft and connecting rods and is divided into three fixed sections cylinder head block and crankcase Cylinders Its holes contain the cylinders mental tubes depending on the vehicle type that depending on the diameter determine the engine displacement Whereby fuel burning happens and piston reciprocated Some other holes in the engine are the much needed coolant and oil flow paths required for cooling and lubrication Pistons The rotational force that is generated on the wheels starts with the movement of the piston Pistons are in charge of transferring the energy that is created during the combustion cycle and transmitting it to the crankshaft propelling our vehicles Pistons do this by moving up and down inside the cylinders pushed by the heat and expanding gases The engines crankshaft which is connected via rods to the pistons then spins and powers the cars drive wheels Crankshaft This is located in the lower section of the engine block and is designed to convert the pistons linear up and down motion into a rotational and reciprocal motion working at engine speed It is a finely machined component as it requires very accurate component as it requires very accurate balancing in order to function properly It has holes to ensure that it doesnt lose balance while rotating at high speed.

FB. PISTON Piston is a moving part of the combustion chamberIt is responsible for converting the energy released during the combustion process into mechanical workA piston in a moving disk inclosed in a cylinder which is made gastight by piston ringsThe disk moves inside the cylinder as a liquid or gas inside the cylinder expands and contractsA piston aids in the transformation of heat energy into mechanical work and vise versa It is also a key component of a cars engine that moves up and down in a cylinder to convert heat energy from combustion into kinetic energyThis energy turns the crankshaft which powers the wheelsPistons are also used in compressorspumps and other machinery The piston pushes upwardcompressing the fuel and air into a smaller space in the cylinder head A spark plug ignites the compressed fuel and aircausing and explosion The explosion forces the piston downward creating exhaust gases The pistons movement transforms the energy of combustion into mechanical energy The piston sends this energy down through the connecting rod and spins the crankshaft Three types of pistons named for its shape a Flat top pistons have smallest surface area on top bDish pistons have a recused enter that resembles a dish which provides space for the fuel air mixture to improve combustion efficiency cDome pistons have a raisedcurved shape that forms the structural floor of the combustion chamber Piston quality can effect how well a car runsUsing poor quality gasoline can cause piston to crack which may prevent the car from runningCracked pistons can also be a symptom of other problems such as a failure in the exhausted gas recirculation system.

A car gearbox also known as a transmission is a mechanical device that transfers power from the engine to the wheels by using a set of gears to change the speed and torque The gears are arranged in different patterns to provide different speeds while keeping the engine running well Gearboxes are a key part of the powertrain along with the engine and wheels and help cars handle horsepower There are two main types of gearboxes in cars manual and automatic Both types use complex gear systems but they operate differently depending on how the driver interacts with them In an automatic transmission the driver doesnt need to manually shift gears When the driver shifts the car into drive the transmission can move between all the available forward gear ratios as needed The transmission uses brake bands and clutches to change gears in the planetary gearset The bands tighten to hold a gear in place or loosen to allow it to spin and the combination of stationary and spinning gears creates each gear ratio The clutches also help determine the gear ratio the planetary gearset is creating and the driver can change gear ratios by tightening and loosening the clutches and bands This is controlled by hydraulics electronics or both.
